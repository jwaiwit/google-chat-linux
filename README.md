# google-chat-linux-git

An electron-base client for Google Hangouts Chat, since Google didn't see fit to provide one.

upstream project : https://github.com/robyf/google-chat-linux

I'm not the author of the app : praise **robyf** for his excellent work.

I'm barely maintaining it for my own use now that he left off.

## Systray Support

**Note** : from 0.5 on, electron 9 bring back Tray integration BUT "click" events are ignored.

More precisely :

* On Linux the app indicator will be used if it is supported, otherwise GtkStatusIcon will be used instead.
* When app indicator is used on Linux, the click event is ignored.
* https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/tray
* There is sadly nothing I can do about it. (except cry a bit as such nonsenses and wonder how other apps (slack, telegram) deal with all this)


**Note** : from 0.4.1 on, electron moved to electron-8, with a different Tray integration implementation. It may fail to work with some window managers (Cinnamon is one of them)

See https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445

To use previous Tray implementation :
- edit package.json
- replace `"electron": "^8.0.0"` by `"electron": "^7.0.0"`
- run `npm install`and give it a try. (npm start or ./google-chat-linux.sh, see below for detailed instructions)

## IMPORTANT NEWS

0.5.1

Alt-Left / Alt-Right navigation shortcuts are disabled now by default. Reenable them in menu (restart required)

0.5.0-3

Electron 9, which has reverted to 'old' systray integration. Should help someDE users to have this work.

**Notes** 

* going back to electron 8 or previous is not as simple as changing version in package.json anymore. Look at package.json history to see the changes.
* packages 0.5.0-1 and 0.5.0-2 do **not** work. Avoid tthem, use 0.5.0-3.


0.4.4

- Secure tray icon change.
- Avoid renderer processes to be restarted on every navigation. 
- Add 'About' menu to display version.
- Restart app to 'keep minimized' configuration takes effect.

0.4.3

- by default keep window in windows list when 'closing'. Add a 'view' menu to change back to previous behaviour : hiding on 'close'. This is done for DE that does NOT display systray of eletron 8 : *Cinnamon* for instance, any DE that doesn't handle well 'appindicator' in electron 8.
- At first run, shows in windows list on close to prevent lost windows on those DE.
- Change color of minimized window icon for those DE.

0.4.2 adds a "Menu" in app, press Alt to reveal it. It's the same as systray menu, for OS's where systray is not (yet?) properly supported

from 0.4.1 : update to electron 8 for better Systray compatibility on linux when appindicator lib is used. see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445. You may have to install some plugnis depending on your DE (xfce4-statusnotifier-plugin for instance)

from 0.4.0 on : **systray** color works without hidden window, so everything should be ok again!

from 0.3.2 on : **systray icon color change IS BACK** through the use of a hidden window ... kind of dirty but seems to work.

on version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 : **systray icon color change does not work anymore**, I volontarily removed it. Why ? It requires "nodeIntegration: true" in electron, which in turn breaks the "Search" for people (Ctrl K), which is much, much more useful than the icon color change.

As a compensation, there is a custom theme ... :) (activate it from systray menu)

## build and run

```sh
npm install
./google-chat-linux.sh
```

## make it work manually

electron 6 beta is required, 7 recommended
(works with 5.0.1 and up, with some minor annoyances)

```sh
npm install electron
export PATH=$HOME/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

fix the rights on sandbox executable as the error message will suggest:

```sh
sudo chown root:root $HOME/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox && sudo chown 4755 $HOME/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
electron .
```
    
OR if you're in a hurry :

```sh
export ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=true; export NODE_OPTIONS="--no-force-async-hooks-checks"; electron .
```

## Linux packages

## Arch (Manjaro, Antergos)

a package 'google-chat-linux-git' is availabe on AUR for Arch Linux and derivatives.

## Debian based (Ubuntu, Mint ...)

**Tested on** Ubuntu 18.04, Mint

**Note** some envionment varaibles are set in index.js : ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX and NODE_OPTIONS="--no-force-async-hooks-checks". This *should* work. Else, set them manually.

Run :

```sh
npm run dist
```

will build a .deb file in `dist/`. Run for instance `sudo dkpg -i dist/google-chat-linux*.deb`.

Installation of the .deb file is tested under Ubuntu, and works fine. Under Mint it installs well but react with emotes crashes the app. Go wonder.

NOTE : to run from a terminal you'll have to :

- either `sudo chown root:root /opt/google-chat-linux/chrome-sandbox && sudo chown 4755 /opt/google-chat-linux/chrome-sandbox` after the .deb is inYYstalled
- or run `export ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=true; export NODE_OPTIONS="--no-force-async-hooks-checks"` before the launch of `/opt/google-chat-linux/google-chat-linux`

The provided .desktop file takes care of it, so running from your desktop launcher will work.
